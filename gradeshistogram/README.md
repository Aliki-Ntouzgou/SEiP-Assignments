# Grades Histogram

This project is created for the purposes of getting more familiar with how build automation tools work and, more specifically, how to work
with <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, applied in a simple java project that reads a file with integers and generated a diagram, 
using the <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/jfree/jfreechart>jfreechart</a> dependency.
